# Hi, I’m Simo

Senior computational biologist working in systems biology and drug discovery, with a focus on network-based modelling, transcriptomics, and reproducible computational workflows.

I design and implement analysis pipelines for multi-omics integration, network inference, and differential analysis across conditions and cohorts, with emphasis on robustness, reproducibility, and biological interpretability.

## Selected Technical Work

### scRNAseq-pbmc-workflow
Production-style RNA-seq workflow (Docker + Snakemake + explicit Python CLI wrapper) demonstrating:

- FASTQ-level QC and reference preparation  
- STARsolo alignment  
- Donor-aware differential analysis (DESeq2 + TOST)  
- Co-expression and network-based downstream analysis  
- Explicit execution control via wrapper interface  
- Fully containerized, reproducible execution
