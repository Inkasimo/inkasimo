# Hi, I’m Simo

Senior computational biologist working at the intersection of systems biology, transcriptomics, and drug discovery.

I design and implement reproducible computational workflows for multi-omics integration, network inference, and mechanism-driven data interpretation. My work focuses on extracting robust biological signal from high-dimensional datasets and translating systems-level insights into drug prioritisation and biomarker strategies.

I am a licensed pharmacist in Finland with clinical and pharmacological training that informs my systems pharmacology and translational modelling work. I also bring a background in evolutionary population ecology, shaping my perspective on biological variation and selection.
