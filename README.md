# Hi, I’m Simo

Senior computational biologist working in systems biology and drug discovery, with a focus on network-based modelling, transcriptomics, and reproducible computational workflows.

I design and implement analysis pipelines for multi-omics integration, network inference, and differential analysis across conditions and cohorts, with emphasis on robustness, reproducibility, and biological interpretability.
